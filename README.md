I will probably use Github to post totally random stuff I make to extend my knowledge. (besides Salesforce, it has it's own trailhead site to learn and do stuff on).

My respository is going to see (or at least should) some Sites, Apps, random things in python and Minecraft mods, cause it's a optional way to learn Java isn't it?
